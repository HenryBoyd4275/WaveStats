## Wave Stats Calculator

Input your data to calculate the changes in the wave as the depth of the water decreases.

Currently the app can be launched by running the command "\$ Yarn Start" in the project folder.

Either the wind form or the wave form can then be filled out.

The download button outputs a CSV file with the current Data Table results.

Please see the [attatched background material PDF](https://github.com/HenryBoyd4275/WaveStats/blob/master/docs/Wave%20calculator%20background%20material.pdf) in docs for a more detailed explanation.
