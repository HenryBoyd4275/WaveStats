## Wave Stats Calculator

Input your data to calculate the changes in the wave as the depth of the water decreases.

Currently the app can be launched by running the command `$ Yarn Start` in the project folder in whatever terminal you prefer.

Either the Wind Form or the Wave Form can then be filled out.

The download button outputs a CSV file with the current Data Table results.

Please see the [attatched background material PDF](https://github.com/HenryBoyd4275/WaveStats/blob/master/docs/Wave%20calculator%20background%20material.pdf) in docs for a more detailed explanation.
